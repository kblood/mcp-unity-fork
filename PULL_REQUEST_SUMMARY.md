## Summary
This PR adds comprehensive scene management capabilities to MCP Unity, enabling AI assistants to create, load, save, and manage Unity scenes programmatically without Unity dialog interruptions.

### ðŸ†• New Features Added
- **Scene Creation** (`create_scene`) - Create scenes with templates (empty, basic, 2D, 3D)
- **Scene Loading** (`load_scene`) - Load scenes by name/path with single/additive modes  
- **Scene Saving** (`save_scene`) - Save current/all scenes with save-as functionality
- **Scene Information** (`unity://scenes`) - Comprehensive scene metadata and status
- **Build Integration** - Automatic build settings management

### ðŸ”§ Key Improvements in v1.2.3
- **Fixed save-as functionality bug** - Now correctly uses active scene as source
- **Enhanced directory handling** - Automatically creates target directories
- **Improved error handling** - Better validation and user feedback
- **Dialog bypass** - All operations work programmatically without Unity dialogs

### ðŸ§ª Tested Functionality
- âœ… Scene creation with all template types
- âœ… Scene loading in single and additive modes
- âœ… Scene saving (current, all, save-as operations)
- âœ… Build settings integration
- âœ… Directory auto-creation
- âœ… Error handling and edge cases
- âœ… No dialog window interruptions

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits for Users
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Quickly create and test game ideas
- **Educational Development** - AI can teach scene management workflows
- **Team Collaboration** - Standardize scene creation processes
- **Testing Automation** - Create test scenes programmatically
- **Project Organization** - Better scene structure management

### ðŸ“‹ Technical Implementation
**New C# Unity Editor Tools:**
- `CreateSceneTool.cs` - Scene creation with templates
- `LoadSceneTool.cs` - Scene loading with modes
- `SaveSceneTool.cs` - Scene saving and backup operations
- `GetScenesResource.cs` - Scene information provider

**New TypeScript MCP Server Tools:**
- Corresponding MCP interfaces for all scene tools
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Full async operation support

### ðŸŽ® Usage Examples
```bash
# Create scenes with templates
"Create a 3D scene called 'GameLevel1' and add it to build settings"

# Save and backup workflows  
"Save the current scene as a backup to Assets/Backups/"

# Load scenes with modes
"Load the MainMenu scene in additive mode"

# Project analysis
"Show me all scenes in the project and their build settings status"
```

### ðŸ”„ Compatibility
- âœ… **Fully backward compatible** with existing MCP Unity functionality
- âœ… **No breaking changes** to existing tools or workflows
- âœ… **Unity 2022.3+ LTS** support maintained
- âœ… **All existing tests pass** with new functionality

This enhanced version has been thoroughly tested and solves the dialog window handling issues that were identified in previous testing sessions. All scene management operations now work seamlessly through programmatic APIs.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Differentiator
Unlike Unity's upcoming 6.2 AI features that focus on content generation, this enhancement focuses on **Editor automation and workflow management**, making it complementary to Unity's native AI tools.
